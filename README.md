# YTPO - Youtube playlist organizer
YouTube and YouTube music's playlist organization capabilities are severely lacking. Therefore, YTPO is a nifty app that allows you to organize your playlist via a host of methods.

## Options
### Folder mode
This mode retrieves all of your playlists, creates a folder for each playlist and fills each folder with filenames for each item in the playlist. Once the directory tree is generated, you can do the following - 
1. Copy/Move songs from one playlist folder to another
2. Delete songs from a playlist folder

The app will then remotely update your playlists to match the directory tree. The orders of songs within a playlist is preserved and new songs are added to the bottom of the playlist. 


## TODO
- Package the app as a python module
- List file mode
- Prune duplicate entries
- Append playlist to another playlist
- Shuffle playlist
